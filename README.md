# AdventOfCode2021
My take on the 2021 Advent of Code Christmas challenge
Every folder holds my solution, input file, and a file with the solved example from the day's worked example.
The solutions are usually built as follows:
1. Function for input parsing.
2. Function solving the 1st challenge.
3. Function solving the 2nd challenge.
4. Calling the different functions and asserting the solving functions using the given examples.

My current solutions are listed here:
1. Day 1a 1b
2. Day 2a 2b
3. Day 3a 3b
4. Day 4a 4b
5. Day 5a 5b
6. Day 6a 6b
